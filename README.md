# Assignments Description
## Assignment1
In assignment 1, I have completed three tasks. The goal of these tasks is to help us get familiar with Spark operations (e.g., transformations and actions) and MapReduce.
## Assignment2
In assignment2, I have implemented the **SON** algorithm using the Apache Spark Framework. Finding frequent itemsets in two datasets, one simulated dataset and one real-world dataset generated from Yelp dataset. The goal of this assignment is to apply the algorithms we have learned in class on large datasets more efficiently in a **distributed environment**.

## Assignment3

In Assignment 3, I have completed three tasks. The goal is to be familiar with **Min-Hash, Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)**, and **various types of recommendation systems**.

## Assignment4

In assignment 4,I have explored the spark GraphFrames library as well as implemented my own Girvan-Newman algorithm using the Spark Framework to **detect communities in graphs**. I have tried to deal with dataset for finding users who have a similar business taste. The goal of this assignment is to understand how to use the **Girvan-Newman algorithm** to detect communities in an efficient way within a **distributed environment**.

## Assignment5

In Assignment 5, I have implemented the **K-Means and Bradley-Fayyad-Reina (BFR) algorithm**. The goal is to be familiar with clustering algorithms with various distance measurements. 

## Assignment6

In this assignment, I have implemented three algorithms: **the Bloom filtering, Flajolet- Martin algorithm, and reservoir sampling**. For the first task, I have implemented Bloom Filtering for off-line Yelp business dataset. For the second and the third task, I have dealed with online streaming data directly. In the second task, I have implemented Flajolet-Martin algorithm with Spark Streaming library. In the third task, I have done some analysis on Twitter stream using fixed size sampling (Reservoir Sampling).
