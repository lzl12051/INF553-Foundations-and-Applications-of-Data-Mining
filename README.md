Assignments code of the INF553 class.

# Assignments Description
## Assignment1
In assignment 1, I have completed three tasks. The goal of these tasks is to help us get familiar with Spark operations (e.g., transformations and actions) and MapReduce.
## Assignment2
In assignment2, I have implemented the **SON** algorithm using the Apache Spark Framework. I have developed a program to find frequent itemsets in two datasets, one simulated dataset and one real-world dataset generated from Yelp dataset. The goal of this assignment is to apply the algorithms we have learned in class on large datasets more efficiently in a distributed environment.
